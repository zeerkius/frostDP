# coin-change-analysis
A deep dive into the coin change problem: counting ways, optimizing coins, analyzing contributions, and exploring DP structures with unlimited and bounded coin scenarios.

## Features

### Combinatorial Analysis
- **Total ways** to reach a target `T` using unlimited coins.
- **Most/least contributing coins** across all solutions.
- Probabilistic and structural insights into the DP table.

### Optimization
- **Minimum number of coins** required to reach `T`.
- **Contribution analysis** for coins in optimized solutions.

### Enumeration
- Generate **all combinations** of coins summing to `T`.
- Generate **all distinct sets** of coins summing to `T`.

### Bounded Coin Variants
- **k-limited coins**: analyze the number of ways to reach `T`.
- **Minimum coins with bounded resources**.
